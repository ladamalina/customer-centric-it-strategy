00:00:00.185 --> 00:00:05.071
In the last video, we introduced
the business model canvas as a tool.

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:09.039
To make sure you're anchored in what's
really valuable and important to

3
00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:13.500
the company where you're going to do
your IT enterprise software project.

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.475
In this video,

5
00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:19.351
we're going to answer the first of three
really critical questions that we need

6
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:24.091
to answer to be thoughtful about what
we put in this business model canvas.

7
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:27.540
This is our key tool, this will
help us drive to more meaningful,

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.623
better validated problem scenarios.

9
00:00:29.623 --> 00:00:33.474
So we don't create enterprise
software that no one wants and

10
00:00:33.474 --> 00:00:34.992
no one finds valuable.

11
00:00:34.992 --> 00:00:39.383
This question, more than anything else,
is really the independent variable.

12
00:00:39.383 --> 00:00:44.082
And the driver for the contents of
the rest of the business model.

13
00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:48.234
Here's an example of what this might look
like for Home Depot, you can see here,

14
00:00:48.234 --> 00:00:49.900
different customer segments.

15
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.473
So these might be themselves personas, or

16
00:00:52.473 --> 00:00:55.763
sets of personas about people
that shop at Home Depot.

17
00:00:55.763 --> 00:01:00.923
And here are some made up by me, and
I am not an expert on hardware retail.

18
00:01:00.923 --> 00:01:06.363
Value propositions that seem like they're
important for such an organization.

19
00:01:06.363 --> 00:01:09.942
And these arrows that you see here,
like the red arrow, the gray arrow.

20
00:01:09.942 --> 00:01:14.717
These say that, okay, for example,
contractors find, hypothetically,

21
00:01:14.717 --> 00:01:19.133
this value proposition and
this value proposition, most important.

22
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:24.260
And basically, this is what we want
to arrive at by the end of the video.

23
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.051
So, take a minute, and think about
the customer segments for your business,

24
00:01:29.051 --> 00:01:30.732
are there multiple parts?

25
00:01:30.732 --> 00:01:36.193
Like, for example, eBay has buyers and
sellers, those are at least two segments.

26
00:01:36.193 --> 00:01:39.610
What are they, and
take a minute and write those down.

27
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.922
Here's what those looks like for
United Children's Theater.

28
00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:49.133
So basically you have children
are really the end users.

29
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.933
But they, of course,
arrange these things and

30
00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:56.213
participate in them with the assistance
and guidance of their parents.

31
00:01:56.213 --> 00:02:00.210
Teachers and administrators of the public
schools guide the students to go ahead and

32
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.753
enroll in these programs,
if they're interested.

33
00:02:02.753 --> 00:02:06.625
And they manage the logistics, for
instance, of a school coming and

34
00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:07.509
seeing a play.

35
00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.402
And then finally, these are non profit and
they have donors who help support them.

36
00:02:13.402 --> 00:02:15.401
Now we look at value proposition.

37
00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:21.056
So what are the really, really compelling
reasons that a customer buys your product,

38
00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:23.462
uses your service, whatever it is?

39
00:02:23.462 --> 00:02:28.192
What are they getting out of it that's
important to them and uniquely compelling?

40
00:02:28.192 --> 00:02:31.374
Take a minute and
think about that for your project.

41
00:02:31.374 --> 00:02:35.416
And remember, if you're not sure, the best
thing to do here is not to hand a blank

42
00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:38.162
business model canvas to your boss,
or your manager.

43
00:02:38.162 --> 00:02:41.832
But I would say, in most cases,
it's to sketch out a bunch of ideas for

44
00:02:41.832 --> 00:02:42.777
them to react to.

45
00:02:42.777 --> 00:02:46.056
And make it easy for
them to help you edit these things.

46
00:02:46.056 --> 00:02:50.282
So even if you're not positive about
these, and it's not your job to define

47
00:02:50.282 --> 00:02:53.465
this, my advice is,
take a few minutes, sketch it out.

48
00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.237
It'll make it quicker for
you to get to a nice, quick,

49
00:02:56.237 --> 00:03:00.237
workable answer on these things that
will help you proceed with your project.

50
00:03:03.373 --> 00:03:07.201
Here's what these look like for
United Children's Theater.

51
00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:11.150
It's got to be affordable,
they're having an outsource arts function,

52
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.914
is a great thing for these folks.

53
00:03:12.914 --> 00:03:16.595
Cultivating the arts locally, and
improving the quality of education for

54
00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:19.701
low income pupils is something
that's important for donors.

55
00:03:19.701 --> 00:03:23.618
And this is, of course,
important for parents and

56
00:03:23.618 --> 00:03:26.544
the children benefit from it as well.

57
00:03:26.544 --> 00:03:31.232
And here's what this would look like
sketched out on the business model canvas.

58
00:03:31.232 --> 00:03:35.992
These arrows, just like you saw with the
Home Depot example, are linking segments

59
00:03:35.992 --> 00:03:40.072
and the value propositions that
are particularly compelling to them.

60
00:03:40.072 --> 00:03:43.192
We'll show you this in
some of the examples.

61
00:03:43.192 --> 00:03:48.073
But I recommend actually sitting down with
a paper version of this canvas first,

62
00:03:48.073 --> 00:03:49.883
sketching these things out.

63
00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:52.210
I'm also going to show you
a Google Doc that you can use,

64
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.802
if you want to have something that's
editable, and sharable, and presentable.

65
00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:58.942
But it's a little more
cumbersome to work with,

66
00:03:58.942 --> 00:04:03.626
and I think you'll find it easiest to
sketch this out on a piece of paper.

67
00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:06.239
Or a printed version of
the business model canvas,

68
00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.742
which we've supplied in
the lesson materials.

69
00:04:08.742 --> 00:04:09.343
So here,

70
00:04:09.343 --> 00:04:14.461
we've see how to look at this really key
relationship between these two things.

71
00:04:14.461 --> 00:04:17.462
And this thing that drives
the rest of the business model.

72
00:04:17.462 --> 00:04:21.015
In the next two videos,
we'll look at the customer journey, and

73
00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:23.091
we'll pencil these things out here.

74
00:04:23.091 --> 00:04:26.773
And then we'll look at what's
strategically important to the business

75
00:04:26.773 --> 00:04:30.227
and we'll do these items here,
key activities and key resources.
