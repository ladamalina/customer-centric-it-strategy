1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.265
I love enterprise software.

2
00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:06.670
I've always loved it, and I love to see how end users use it.

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.450
A lot of the companies I advise,

4
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.430
people want to make the next tender or whatever,

5
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.880
but I'm always fascinated to walk into an office with a bunch of cubicles and

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.610
watch what those people do and the tools that

7
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.765
they have to do their job and how they like those things.

8
00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:25.840
So here's the thing. A lot of them don't like the tools they have.

9
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.995
So, enterprise software can be really awesome and yet it's often not.

10
00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:34.450
If you look at these stats here for CRM projects,

11
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.065
which are a reasonable proxy and a big part of enterprise software,

12
00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:41.060
you see these kind of horrifying failure rates.

13
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.120
And that's sad because a lot of work goes

14
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.740
into these projects and a lot of people end up using

15
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.230
the software and not to attribute

16
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.120
the dynamics of the entire US economy to enterprise software,

17
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.560
but around 2007, you see a dip in labor productivity.

18
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.310
So, make better enterprise software and maybe you can

19
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.680
save the whole economy. How do we do that?

20
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.275
Well, I think there are four things that,

21
00:01:10.275 --> 00:01:13.220
using Azure, we can readily improve on.

22
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.700
One is order taking versus consulting.

23
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.785
Because there's this idea that

24
00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:22.420
enterprise software is this tool that automates what people do,

25
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.850
there is this idea that,

26
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.430
okay, well, we just need to go in,

27
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.180
and we'll talk to the sales department and the service department,

28
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.980
and they'll tell us what they want,

29
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.250
and we will put it up in the software and then we will give in what they want,

30
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.785
and if they don't like it, then we've done our job.

31
00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:41.905
Well, that's part of what leads to these bad outcomes, I think.

32
00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:44.600
Our job, and you'll be fully capable of

33
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.660
this by the end of the course in the specialization,

34
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.280
is to be consultants.

35
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.110
So, even if your job title isn't consultant,

36
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.770
you are learning the tools here to be able to help

37
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.605
others in a consultative way to drive to better outcomes.

38
00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:03.310
And the tools you're going to learn here over the course of

39
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.580
this module are going to help you go into this enterprise software implementations,

40
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.765
engage within the parameters that you have available to you,

41
00:02:10.765 --> 00:02:13.655
and drive to more valuable outcomes.

42
00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:15.580
Here's an example of this,

43
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.945
a sort of simple dramatization.

44
00:02:17.945 --> 00:02:21.270
Enterprise software person asks functional manager,

45
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.990
"What drop-down do you want to put here

46
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.310
because the enterprise software has a drop-down here?"

47
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.660
And they say, "Well, I'm really busy.

48
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.170
We did this in my last six jobs.

49
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.490
Why don't we just do the same thing?"

50
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.890
And we continue the cycle of way less than

51
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.605
optimal outcomes for enterprise software projects.

52
00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:41.895
Building versus designing is a similar kind of symptom.

53
00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.450
We're always on a schedule.

54
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.880
We're trying to roll this stuff out.

55
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.870
There's this idea that that software didn't work and nobody liked it.

56
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.510
So we'll get a different software,

57
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.055
and we'll put that in here now and now it'll fix everything.

58
00:02:55.055 --> 00:02:58.075
And the reality is that doesn't work.

59
00:02:58.075 --> 00:03:01.490
Enterprise software is this great products out there.

60
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.195
They're very fast sale.

61
00:03:03.195 --> 00:03:05.870
Most of them, they're pretty easy to customize and tailor,

62
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.010
but you have to be thoughtful about that.

63
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.100
You have to iterate and think like

64
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.455
a designer using these tools that we have to get to a good outcome,

65
00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:17.525
not just crank through it and just get it working.

66
00:03:17.525 --> 00:03:20.240
And that's not always easy.

67
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.220
You have to develop a set of skills to basically sell your stakeholders on

68
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.450
why you need a little bit of time in

69
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.825
these other sort of non-obvious areas like learning about the users,

70
00:03:30.825 --> 00:03:33.645
observing, working in short cycles that have

71
00:03:33.645 --> 00:03:37.450
observation at the end to drive to these valuable outcomes.

72
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.520
And what you're learning through the course is specialization,

73
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.675
and you'll learn some IT specific tools here to do that,

74
00:03:43.675 --> 00:03:46.100
totally related to this idea that we're

75
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.700
going to paper over the problems we have with software.

76
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.850
Well, anybody who's been doing

77
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.620
enterprise software for a while knows that that just doesn't work.

78
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.295
Software can do automation,

79
00:03:58.295 --> 00:03:59.820
and it can standardize things,

80
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.335
and it can be beautifully built,

81
00:04:01.335 --> 00:04:05.140
but ultimately, it's managers that run the business.

82
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.590
The software can help them.

83
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.790
But if you're not sure what your processes are,

84
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.320
if they're not well thought through with

85
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.655
people's roles in their inner change or handicapped,

86
00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:15.765
software, by and large,

87
00:04:15.765 --> 00:04:18.005
in this context can do very little to help that.

88
00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:20.810
We need to think through what we want to have happen and

89
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.665
then allow software to automate and standardize it.

90
00:04:24.665 --> 00:04:27.945
So, we often hear things like,

91
00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:30.320
"We didn't work on order management process because

92
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.825
we figured we'd just get that from the software."

93
00:04:32.825 --> 00:04:34.300
Well, that's a big mistake,

94
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.320
and we're going learn how to fix that here through process design as a prototyping tool.

95
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.325
Finally, big batches versus iteration.

96
00:04:42.325 --> 00:04:43.650
We've talked a lot about this,

97
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.825
but it's just as common in enterprise software as it is everywhere else.

98
00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:50.200
And it's important to work

99
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.040
through things in these small iterations that we have an Azure,

100
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.585
and it is massively helpful in enterprise software projects.

101
00:04:57.585 --> 00:04:59.985
So, here's an example.

102
00:04:59.985 --> 00:05:01.275
People want plans.

103
00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:05.670
You're going to learn how to show them equally structured alternatives that do

104
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.080
a better job of iterating through

105
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.170
the ambiguity that's inherent in any big internal project.

106
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.820
Now, I don't have some magic silver bullet to fix

107
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.395
these things except for the fundamentals of Azure itself,

108
00:05:18.395 --> 00:05:22.440
but we are going to go through a few practices that I think will really help you.

109
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.665
Here's how they tie in with the work we've been doing.

110
00:05:25.665 --> 00:05:29.915
We're going to learn how to use the business model canvas to identify

111
00:05:29.915 --> 00:05:33.240
key focal points in problem scenarios and

112
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.300
relate them back to the core of what's important to the business.

113
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.140
We're going to learn to use process design.

114
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.110
Now, I know you hear process design.

115
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.420
You probably have terrible associations with that.

116
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.675
But trust me, this process design technique, we're going to learn here,

117
00:05:49.675 --> 00:05:54.855
is as facile and useful as the user stories and the prototypes that you've been seeing.

118
00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:58.670
And then finally, we're going to learn how to organize and have

119
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.780
a regular cadence around iterative observation improvement with zero, 30,

120
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.400
and 90 day success criteria,

121
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.280
and that'll help us think about what's important here,

122
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.780
here and here as we progress through a piece of

123
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.000
functionality being implemented and handed over to users.

124
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.075
So, in the videos that follow,

125
00:06:18.075 --> 00:06:20.190
we're going to move through these key points here,

126
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.860
and I think you'll find some really useful tools

127
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.460
to make your enterprise software and IT projects better.
