1
00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.856
In the last video, we looked at these
two items here, Customer Segments and

2
00:00:05.856 --> 00:00:07.087
Value Propositions.

3
00:00:07.087 --> 00:00:12.020
And how does the interchange of
these two things drive the business.

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.990
Here, we are going to look at
the end-to-end customer experience, and

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.990
what that means for
the relationships and channels,

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.200
that the business has with the customer
over the course of that journey.

7
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.420
The way I like to think through that,
is with this framework that you see here.

8
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.250
So first we ask,
how do we get the customer's attention?

9
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.570
How do they even know we exist?

10
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.690
How do we break through the noise floor?

11
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.240
Then, we look at what's
interesting about our proposition.

12
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.190
What problem that we know that they have,
be that a job that they do,

13
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.900
a desire, a habit.

14
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.680
What is it that we engage them with,
what interests them.

15
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.470
And if we want them to do anything
of any real material importance,

16
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.580
there's some emotional resonance
to what we're offering them, and

17
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.970
there's a desire that they have
that's propelling them to action.

18
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.950
Here, we're looking at, what is
the absolute minimum set of actions

19
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.760
required for the customer to
get to the next step with us?

20
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.260
And that's something we want to
be especially thoughtful about,

21
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.150
as we design systems.

22
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.650
Then, we look at how does
the customer get onboarded.

23
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.145
How do we make them a regular,
habitual user of our product, and

24
00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:22.040
how do we know if that's working?

25
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.623
And then finally, we kind of look
at everything beyond that and

26
00:01:25.623 --> 00:01:29.218
the customer's recurring use
of our product with retention.

27
00:01:29.218 --> 00:01:32.279
And how do we deepen their
involvement with our product,

28
00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:36.140
and how do we get them talking
positively about it to others?

29
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.855
Now again, even if your software
isn't directly touching the customer.

30
00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:45.795
These things are almost certainly going to
have major implications for it, and

31
00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:50.355
it's important for you to be at least
generally aware of how they work.

32
00:01:50.355 --> 00:01:55.227
Here is a storyboard for AIDAOR,
the framework we just looked at,

33
00:01:55.227 --> 00:01:58.150
and United Children's Theater.

34
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.310
In the attention step here,
mom A talks with mom B,

35
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.610
who has her child in a program
at United Children's Theater.

36
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.080
And they talk about how the mommy's
son doesn't want to do soccer, so

37
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.880
maybe children's theory
would be a good fit.

38
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.810
Mom B follows up with mom
A through an email, and a link to

39
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.820
some information about United Children's
Theater, that engages her interest.

40
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.030
Mom A doesn't want her son,
Carlos, in trouble or

41
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.080
idling around the house, so she had
this real desire to get him out and

42
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.490
get him associated with good, thoughtful
kids in some constructive activity.

43
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.016
Action, while she goes to
United Children's Theater site and

44
00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:44.725
it's clear to her what she gets,
what she pays for,

45
00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:48.070
whether there's financial aid
available and when she starts.

46
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.923
And then the next step here is Onboarding,
and

47
00:02:50.923 --> 00:02:53.419
what happens on the first day of school?

48
00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.610
How does Carlos get started
with the right program.

49
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.990
And then Retention, we look at the use
of email, a Facebook group and so forth.

50
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.790
Carlos, let's say he
completes a successful

51
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.980
year at United Children's Theater.

52
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.550
What's in store for him next year?

53
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.710
And how does he know if wants to do it and
if so, what we do?

54
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.040
All that would fall into
the retention basket.

55
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.460
So think through this and
I highly recommend the storyboard.

56
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.800
And how does this work for
your key customer relationships, and

57
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.890
your key channels?

58
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.710
That's what we'll look at next.

59
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.934
Another thing you consider doing,
if you're interested in this,

60
00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:33.374
is you've learned about Think,
See, Feel, Do.

61
00:03:33.374 --> 00:03:36.700
How do each of those work at
every step of this process?

62
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.730
That's something we call a journey map,
and

63
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.400
it's a really good way to think
through customer experience,

64
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.270
if you think that level of
depth would help your project.

65
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.100
Now, one of the things you may have
realized as you went through this customer

66
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.960
journey, using the storyboard, using the
IDA framework, is that the channels and

67
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.180
the types of relationships you
want to have with customer,

68
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.860
vary over the course of that.

69
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.290
So relationships are ways that
we interact with the customer.

70
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.135
There's lots of different possibilities.

71
00:04:08.135 --> 00:04:12.780
The kind of on one end of the spectrum
here is residential Gmail for instance.

72
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.220
If you have a problem, you can search for
it on the forums and ask people,

73
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.190
but it's pretty much self service.

74
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.810
Whereas dedicated personal service for
instance, if you have an insurance

75
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.540
agents who's a specific person, you can
call them up and ask them questions.

76
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.548
That's kind of the other
end of the spectrum,

77
00:04:29.548 --> 00:04:32.180
and there's lots of things in between.

78
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.637
And channels are the way we
deliver that relationship, and

79
00:04:36.637 --> 00:04:41.910
we talked about the AIDAOR journey and
Promotion, Sales, Service.

80
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.738
The channel that you use to deliver
the relationship you want, may vary over

81
00:04:46.738 --> 00:04:51.732
the course of these different types of
activities, over that IDAOR journey.

82
00:04:51.732 --> 00:04:56.191
So let's take a minute and
think about customer relationships for

83
00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:58.295
United Children's Theater.

84
00:04:58.295 --> 00:05:02.855
And I'll reveal that in a minute, but
now when you think about your own project.

85
00:05:02.855 --> 00:05:06.754
And what are the types of customer
relationships that your business or

86
00:05:06.754 --> 00:05:10.125
business you are working with,
has with their customers and

87
00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:14.445
how do they change over the course of
that customer journey that we looked at.

88
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.770
Okay, here's what that looks like for
United Children's Theater.

89
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.530
They use a mix of online community
like the two mom's following up,

90
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.830
the way you saw that.

91
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.230
Personal Service and this happens
both through the center itself,

92
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.470
as well as for
instance mom A meeting mom B.

93
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.934
The parents and the parents auxiliary,
deliver personalized relationships and

94
00:05:37.934 --> 00:05:41.240
word of mouth organically for
United Children's Theater.

95
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.420
And that's a really important
part of their business model and

96
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.698
what makes the business work.

97
00:05:46.698 --> 00:05:49.800
So we want to make sure our enterprise
software doesn't break that for

98
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.140
instance, and then there's
direct personal service as well.

99
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.380
So for instance your child's a teacher,
you know that teacher,

100
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.640
you can talk with them.

101
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.510
And then the channels are the ways
that we deliver these relationships.

102
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.550
So what are the channels that
united children's theater uses?

103
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.980
I'll show you that in a minute,
but think about

104
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.570
the channels that your business uses and
how those vary across the journey.

105
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.650
Take a second and
make a few notes on that.

106
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.390
Okay, here is all of this for
United Children's Theater.

107
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.050
The Parent's Auxiliary does
a lot of Promotion work, and

108
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.060
it's really parent to parent kid to kid,
the promotion.

109
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.510
And the Sales, if you will, is Direct.

110
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.080
The teachers and administrators
at United Children's Theater,

111
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.140
will come to local schools and
talk about their program.

112
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.430
And the teachers and administrators
sort of do these sales if you will,

113
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.250
by discussing the program
with their students.

114
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.950
And then Service, they use the Parent's
Auxiliary and they use Facebook very

115
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.470
heavily, to help parents answer each
other's questions about what's going on.

116
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.060
Here is how this looks in
the business model Canvas.

117
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.990
So I've written the customer relationships
here and the channel's here.

118
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.820
And I made some notes about what
relationships the different segments have.

119
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.380
Now that may or may not be pertinent
to what you have going on.

120
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.100
The nice thing about the canvas is that,
it makes it really easy to sketch and sort

121
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.640
of highlight whatever interrelationships
you think are most important.

122
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.290
And so I would encourage you to make these
notes for the business you're working on.

123
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.540
You can also take a note
about revenue streams and

124
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.420
perhaps, how these relate
to those if you'd like.

125
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.160
And I would finish filling these out, and

126
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.370
think about what are the key
inner relationships.

127
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.303
In the next video, we're going to move
over to this part of the canvas and

128
00:07:37.303 --> 00:07:41.506
look at the activities that your
business executes that are you uniquely,

129
00:07:41.506 --> 00:07:45.375
strategically important to delivering
all these things that we've

130
00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:46.593
talked about so far.
