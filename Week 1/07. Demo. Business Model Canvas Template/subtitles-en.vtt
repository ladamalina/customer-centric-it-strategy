00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.790
I showed you earlier how to go in and edit this business model canvas template.

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.405
Now, because of my unfortunate handwriting,

3
00:00:08.405 --> 00:00:12.390
I think we'll have a better time if I show you how to walk through the canvas using this.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.500
But I would generally suggest that you print out

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.765
the canvas and kind of sketch on it with paper initially.

6
00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:21.230
Otherwise, you may end up getting too absorbed in

7
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.305
the intricacies of how to put stuff into this and so forth.

8
00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:25.865
So anyway, with that said,

9
00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:27.449
let's take a look here.

10
00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.200
Now if you'll remember, this has these different slides that you can

11
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.405
use to call attention to different things and so forth.

12
00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:37.130
But if you want to edit the actual canvas elements here, as it says,

13
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.160
we go to view and we go to master because this is a background slide.

14
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.310
And as you can see here,

15
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.765
we can actually edit these items.

16
00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:49.310
The example I'll go over is United Children's Theater,

17
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.098
the outsourced arts education company that we looked at in the examples.

18
00:00:54.098 --> 00:00:57.635
Now, they have actually a number of different segments that they work with.

19
00:00:57.635 --> 00:01:02.990
So, we'll start with their core users which are children of

20
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.450
there may be various sort of personas but we'll just put

21
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.670
in the segments here and parents.

22
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.320
Maybe we'll leave them in a kind of a paragraph together.

23
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.270
And then teachers, these are people who recommend and kind of work with them,

24
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.835
they work at the public schools.

25
00:01:17.835 --> 00:01:20.840
And administrators, so a

26
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.815
principal or someone who's in charge of an arts program overall at a school.

27
00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:26.113
And then they have donors,

28
00:01:26.113 --> 00:01:28.765
so there are individual donors,

29
00:01:28.765 --> 00:01:35.860
and then there are charitable organizations and

30
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:44.896
government institutions that maybe support the arts groups.

31
00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:46.350
Okay. And I'll just take those those little lines out.

32
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.210
Okay, now customer relationships are the way that they

33
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.844
interface with these different segments to deliver their value propositions.

34
00:01:56.844 --> 00:01:59.700
Now, the customer relationships are the ways that

35
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.626
United Children's Theater in this case delivers their value propositions.

36
00:02:03.626 --> 00:02:06.010
And they do that a few different ways.

37
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.115
They have personal service where

38
00:02:08.115 --> 00:02:11.455
a teacher can call them up and talk to any number of people.

39
00:02:11.455 --> 00:02:15.660
So, since that's kind of a one to many relationship,

40
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.643
it is not one single person to one singled person,

41
00:02:17.643 --> 00:02:23.190
we'll just call that personal service since they're talking to somebody that

42
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.045
they give a name and they

43
00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:29.475
talk to them in a sort of regular person to person conversation.

44
00:02:29.475 --> 00:02:33.445
And then the student-teacher relationship where the student has a specific teacher.

45
00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:36.995
So, that would be what we'd call direct personal service.

46
00:02:36.995 --> 00:02:41.670
Certain student knows that Mr. or Mrs. Carmichael was their teacher.

47
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.665
And then we talked about how they use

48
00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:46.560
a Facebook group a lot so we would make note of that here.

49
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.763
Online community that's a way that parents get questions answered and so forth.

50
00:02:52.763 --> 00:02:54.043
So, those are the as far as I can tell,

51
00:02:54.043 --> 00:02:56.410
we can always come back to this and change it. That's fine.

52
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.955
That is the customer relationships they have.

53
00:02:59.955 --> 00:03:03.450
And the channels are the means through which they

54
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.395
deliver those relationships to their customer segments.

55
00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.720
In this case, they have a few different things.

56
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.607
They have the parents auxiliary,

57
00:03:11.607 --> 00:03:16.440
so this is sort a parents' sort of like a PTA type thing.

58
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.155
They have Facebook, their Facebook group.

59
00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:24.640
And then they have the local schools that's probably the most important channel from

60
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.850
a delivery standpoint where they come in contact with students and future students.

61
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.250
Okay, so now let's go to the revenue stream since

62
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.910
we've kind of covered the customer facing hemisphere of all this.

63
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.615
The way that they make money is I mean they do charge, so they have financial aid.

64
00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:42.733
So, they have tuition as one revenue stream,

65
00:03:42.733 --> 00:03:47.590
they have donations and then they get grants as well which are a little kind of

66
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.230
like donations but of course they have a specific charter and they apply for those.

67
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.910
So, that's our revenue streams.

68
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.725
Now we go to this sort of pivotal item of the value propositions.

69
00:03:59.725 --> 00:04:03.815
What do they do for these people that they care about, these customer segments?

70
00:04:03.815 --> 00:04:05.758
They do a few different things.

71
00:04:05.758 --> 00:04:11.170
So, we'll start with the children and the parents.

72
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.270
So, they deliver quality arts education

73
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.060
and they provide these students a unique peer group.

74
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.150
So, some students may find it most important not so much they're getting

75
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.995
arts education but that they don't relate to the kids that played football or soccer.

76
00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:32.055
They wanted to hang out with another crew and that's maybe what's most important to them.

77
00:04:32.055 --> 00:04:36.415
Affordability is important.

78
00:04:36.415 --> 00:04:40.220
And for the teachers and administrators it's probably that idea of being

79
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.368
able to outsource the arts function is important.

80
00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:48.130
For donors I guess they probably are looking to,

81
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.200
from what we understand, cultivate the arts locally.

82
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.195
So, cultivating the arts locally is what they care about.

83
00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:57.760
And they probably care about enhancing education

84
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:06.595
for low income students.

85
00:05:06.595 --> 00:05:11.910
All right, so I think those are probably their core value propositions.

86
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.125
On the other slides,

87
00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:15.960
you can sort of draw attention to which

88
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.485
customer segments find which value propositions important.

89
00:05:20.485 --> 00:05:23.268
So, now we get to the delivery half of the proposition.

90
00:05:23.268 --> 00:05:27.192
How do they deliver these value propositions as a company?

91
00:05:27.192 --> 00:05:29.700
So, they have a few key activities that we talked

92
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.670
about that have to do with the arts education itself,

93
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.500
raising money and creating

94
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.964
a repeatable infrastructure for delivering this value proposition.

95
00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:42.240
So, in terms of key activities we might have

96
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.015
things like well they do curriculum development.

97
00:05:46.015 --> 00:05:49.725
They don't build a lot of their own curriculum, they go find it in places.

98
00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:53.735
But that's still an important part of building their infrastructure.

99
00:05:53.735 --> 00:05:57.710
Student developments or figuring out how do we take Timmy or

100
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.998
Tamra from grade one to grade six within arts education,

101
00:06:01.998 --> 00:06:05.420
that's maybe what they would call student development.

102
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.615
That's definitely a key activity,

103
00:06:06.615 --> 00:06:11.300
creating a continuity from year to year for the students so that it's not just

104
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.970
one off things but rather sort of a repeatable arc of arts experiences.

105
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.148
And then, what else? School programming,

106
00:06:19.148 --> 00:06:21.740
so being able to deliver plays and things to the schools since

107
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.400
the schools value that and that's how they get in front of that audience.

108
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.620
Volunteer development because so much of

109
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.320
their time that they use to

110
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.620
deliver the service is rendered by parents and other volunteers.

111
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:39.470
And donor involvement, so basically selling donors on staying involved with the cause.

112
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:45.444
And then what are the assets that they have that enable them to do this?

113
00:06:45.444 --> 00:06:47.330
Well, the fact that they have this track record of

114
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.825
doing this for a while is really important.

115
00:06:49.825 --> 00:06:53.200
The facility, the physical building they have let's say is

116
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.030
donated and it's in a central part of town that lots of schools can reach.

117
00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.840
They have a lot of repeat donors,

118
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.780
so those donor relationships are really important.

119
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.290
Their curriculum that they have, that's a resource.

120
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.495
And their volunteer base is also,

121
00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:12.583
I would say, a resource, Okay.

122
00:07:12.583 --> 00:07:15.224
So,there we have an idea on resources.

123
00:07:15.224 --> 00:07:17.535
Now, we'll look at these partners.

124
00:07:17.535 --> 00:07:20.560
So, who are the people that help them execute

125
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.036
their key activities that don't actually work for the company?

126
00:07:25.036 --> 00:07:28.735
And we can think of a few of those, probably the parents,

127
00:07:28.735 --> 00:07:34.040
the volunteers, the schools,

128
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:40.985
donors, city government helps them with donations and space,

129
00:07:40.985 --> 00:07:47.285
content providers give them plays and musicals and so forth.

130
00:07:47.285 --> 00:07:49.024
Now, and their cost structure,

131
00:07:49.024 --> 00:07:50.150
so what are their big cost drivers?

132
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.320
Well, they have teacher salaries,

133
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.415
that's a big one.

134
00:07:53.415 --> 00:07:55.020
They have staff salaries,

135
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.025
so people who help sort of run the business but aren't involved in teaching.

136
00:07:59.025 --> 00:08:03.000
Content licensing of these various plays and so forth.

137
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.570
And production, they've put on these plays.

138
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:12.164
I mean they have to promote them even though obviously people are acting for free.

139
00:08:12.164 --> 00:08:14.850
So, that's a way to kind of pencil this out.

140
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.130
Now, admittedly, I'm familiar with

141
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.320
this company and this exercise so I went through it pretty fast.

142
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.000
But I really do think that after you practice this a few times,

143
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.420
you'll find that you can do a Q&A and you can sketch this out in

144
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.905
about 20 minutes with a collaborator who knows about the business in question.

145
00:08:31.905 --> 00:08:35.670
And you'll probably find that a really useful way to anchor your,

146
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.120
particularly, your IT projects.

147
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.010
And we'll talk over the course of lessons about

148
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.040
how to bring those key activities forward into

149
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.820
a prototyping process so that you make sure you're driving the things that are really

150
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.830
valuable for the business as you implement

151
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:53.770
your IT instead of creating stuff that nobody wants.
