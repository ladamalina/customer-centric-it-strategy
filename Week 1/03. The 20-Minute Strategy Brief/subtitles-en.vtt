00:00:00.931 --> 00:00:04.649
I mentioned in the introduction
that we're going to look at

2
00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:09.141
using the business model canvas to
frame the business' strategy and

3
00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:13.140
anchor our user stories and
prototypes back to that.

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.170
Now, you may be thinking, hey, my job is
just to implement an IT project on time

5
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.510
and on budget, they don't want me to make
strategy and we're not saying that here.

6
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.570
We're just saying we're going to use this
particular shorthand to make sure we

7
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.630
understand the company's strategy and
key facets of the operation,

8
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.610
so that we can dovetail
the enterprise software back to that.

9
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.560
The reality is, if you're running
a residential DSL internet business

10
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.850
versus you're running a private bank for
wealthy individuals,

11
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.209
you're going to need enterprise software
setups that are extremely different.

12
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.550
Vendors do not necessarily do a really
great job of giving you a play book on

13
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.180
how to distinguish these
different situations and

14
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.260
what you ought to do with their software
to make it work well in those situations.

15
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.400
And that's what we're going to cover here,
you're going to learn how to do that.

16
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.090
And once you become fluent
in these techniques,

17
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.810
this module is called the 20
minute strategy brief.

18
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.390
You will be able to sit down and
pencil out a strategy with a client,

19
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.090
internal stakeholder,
whatever in around 20 minutes.

20
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.700
This will help you have some structure
to understand what's valuable.

21
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.250
It will give you nice clear
linkages to success criteria.

22
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.620
And it allow you to drive forward and
backward to and from discussable designs

23
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.790
that are clearly link to the company's
business model and their strategy.

24
00:01:39.362 --> 00:01:42.270
Clients, internal stakeholders
nobody wants to pay for

25
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.190
strategy, often they don't
want to even pay for design.

26
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.860
They think that it's waste of time,

27
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.480
you should just get to the real
work of implementing the software.

28
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.600
But as we've seen, a lot of these
implementations end up a disaster.

29
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.500
In fact, most of them are a failure
in the eyes of key stakeholders.

30
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.219
And so that's pretty important to avoid.

31
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.900
So, we're going to keep
this extremely relevant,

32
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.230
extremely focused around our key goals and
you will find that this is something that

33
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.010
you can do at the very beginning of
a project without making a big stink.

34
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.120
If you are an external vendor of
some sort, enterprise software or

35
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.029
consultant you will be able to do it
very easily in the presales process.

36
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.290
And I think that you'll find that your
collaborators, your stakeholders,

37
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.560
your bosses are going to thank you.

38
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.790
So we're going to use this item,
the business model canvas.

39
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.700
This was created by a man named Alex
Osterwalder and a team of collaborators,

40
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.400
and the nice thing about it is that
it's just a really useful shorthand for

41
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.540
thinking through a business model and
making that very visible.

42
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.110
I think that really in
my experience with it,

43
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.670
these are the three most important
questions that you want to ask about

44
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.400
the business model to
thoughtfully populate it.

45
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.190
And that's what we're going to go
through here in the next few videos.

46
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.542
Before you do that, my recommendation is
you pencil out one of these positioning

47
00:03:00.542 --> 00:03:02.980
statements for
your company or your client.

48
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.825
This is a good way to make sure you've
thought through the basics of what

49
00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:10.569
the business is, who it does work for and

50
00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.800
what's it's primary point
of differentiation.

51
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.160
And these are just things that you'll
want to kind of have on hand before we

52
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.940
dive in too deeply to
the business model canvas.

53
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.160
So even if you're not
positive if it's right,

54
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.900
just try penciling it out real quick.

55
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.500
Here's an example for Home Depot, this is
available in the lesson materials as well.

56
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.320
And here's an example for
United Children's Theater.

57
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.022
This is a non-profit organization that
provides outsource arts education

58
00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:44.525
to students in public schools K-12.

59
00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:48.280
So it's an after-school program for
learning theater and the arts.

60
00:03:49.754 --> 00:03:54.695
We're going to go through this in three
parts as we move through the next

61
00:03:54.695 --> 00:03:55.640
few videos.

62
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.380
The first is who are these buyers and

63
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.550
why do they buy stuff from this company or
use stuff?

64
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.060
What is the end-to-end
customer relationship?

65
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.520
So, how does the customer find out about
this product, buy it, get it, use it?

66
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.663
Keep buying it,
tell other people about it.

67
00:04:11.663 --> 00:04:12.930
How does all that work?

68
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.261
because it turns out, those touch points,
even if we don't directly deal with CRM or

69
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:21.785
Customer Facing Software, understanding
those touch points is a pretty important

70
00:04:21.785 --> 00:04:25.544
part of understanding what kind of
business we're working with, and

71
00:04:25.544 --> 00:04:26.970
what's important to it.

72
00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:32.442
And then we are going to close with
the view of what are the really uniquely

73
00:04:32.442 --> 00:04:37.328
strategically important activities that
the company undertakes to execute its

74
00:04:37.328 --> 00:04:38.540
strategy?

75
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.755
And those go in this portion
of the Business Model Canvas.

76
00:04:43.335 --> 00:04:44.865
Over the next few videos here,

77
00:04:44.865 --> 00:04:47.015
we're going to work through
those three questions.

78
00:04:47.015 --> 00:04:51.260
And at the end of this process you'll be
able to sketch out a business model for

79
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.611
your client or employer in 20 minutes and

80
00:04:53.611 --> 00:04:57.204
link that forward to thoughtful
prototypes, user stories, and

81
00:04:57.204 --> 00:05:00.692
ultimately valuable enterprise
software implementations.
