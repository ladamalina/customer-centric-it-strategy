00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:10.048
It is an exciting time to be in IT, when
your company looks at what it needs to do

2
00:00:10.048 --> 00:00:13.840
to stay competitive,
when looks at digital innovation.

3
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.220
It's probably coming back and
looking at you in IT.

4
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.890
My name is Alex Calen, and before I
became an instructor here at UVA Darden,

5
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.870
I spent years and years in enterprise
software working with IT departments.

6
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.590
I'm really excited for

7
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.100
the things we're going to do together
here in customer centric IT strategy.

8
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.930
There's a lot of great technology
available in IT, which I'm sure you know.

9
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.360
And we've learned so much about start-ups
and the innovation process and what

10
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.030
actually works and what's just kind of
pretending over the last few years.

11
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.870
That I think it's a really great
time to kind of step back and

12
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.180
look at, how do we really
drive better outcomes in IT?

13
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.450
And there's not a silver bullet,
but with some discipline and

14
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.350
some hard work, I think that you can
reliably get much better outcomes.

15
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.160
And we're going to possibly cover
three things in this course.

16
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.950
One is how do we take
tools from innovation that

17
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.920
are used within the practice of agile in
practical ways out in Silicon Valley and

18
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.290
in the community of practice,
how do we apply those in IT?

19
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.034
And specifically, we're going to use
the business model canvas as a tool to

20
00:01:23.034 --> 00:01:27.549
help you focus your stakeholders and
your management team on what they

21
00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.448
actually mean by their strategy and
how do we connect that with actionable,

22
00:01:32.448 --> 00:01:35.691
testable things that we can
do in the domain of IT.

23
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:40.214
And finally, we're going to reboot kind of
old crufty processes like process design

24
00:01:40.214 --> 00:01:44.390
with some new approaches and
some dovetailing with these techniques.

25
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.760
So that they become kind of a prototyping
tool for you to help evaluate

26
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.890
what constitutes a good outcome before
you over invest in an IT system.

27
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.950
That's potentially not going to work
out and get a good outcome for you and

28
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.108
your company.

29
00:01:58.108 --> 00:02:01.860
And throughout, we're going to have
lots of examples, lots of templates and

30
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.240
lots of tools so you can get started with
this stuff in a practical way immediately.

31
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.360
I hope to see you in the course!
