1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.294
In this final segment on the business model canvas, we're going to look at,

2
00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:10.015
what activities are uniquely strategically important to the business.

3
00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:13.535
And that's really important because you're going to deploy

4
00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:18.770
enterprise software very differently to a business whose activities, for instance,

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.665
have to do with residential Internet service,

6
00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:24.350
versus a company with advisors that

7
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.344
service wealthy individuals through a private Swiss bank.

8
00:00:28.344 --> 00:00:30.800
And the first framework where you use to

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.808
think through this was introduced in the late 90s,

10
00:00:33.808 --> 00:00:36.605
and it's called unbundling the corporation.

11
00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:39.680
And their idea was that there are

12
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.180
these three fundamental business model types: infrastructure-driven,

13
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.505
customer scope-driven, and product-driven,

14
00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:53.505
and that successful businesses cohere and focus on just one of these three types.

15
00:00:53.505 --> 00:00:55.650
I'll give you some examples.

16
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.765
Infrastructure-driven businesses are driven by skill and repeatability.

17
00:01:00.765 --> 00:01:03.210
And electric utilities are an example of this,

18
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.619
Telecom are an example of this,

19
00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.523
commodities, companies are also an example.

20
00:01:08.523 --> 00:01:11.299
And then there are some less obvious examples, so,

21
00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.525
UVA, or Stanford, or Georgia Tech,

22
00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:18.385
these are all infrastructure businesses as well,

23
00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:21.605
because while there's lots of thoughtful things that happen,

24
00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:23.340
ultimately, they need to deliver

25
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.840
a good experience to lots and lots of students year after year.

26
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.965
An army or any kind of public service for citizens,

27
00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:36.695
those will tend to be infrastructure businesses as well.

28
00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:40.140
Scope-driven is a business where it's

29
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.520
a valuable thing for the customer that you're able to do a bunch of things for them.

30
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.995
So, retailers tend to be in this category, so,

31
00:01:47.995 --> 00:01:51.780
Neiman Marcus or Harrods put a array

32
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.010
of high end clothing on the racks and make them available to customers,

33
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.013
Toys 'R Us takes toys and educational items for kids of all ages,

34
00:02:01.013 --> 00:02:04.635
and makes them available so that parents can walk in and find what they need.

35
00:02:04.635 --> 00:02:07.090
A bank, both on the corporate and the individual side,

36
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.030
is often a business that is trying to achieve scope with customers.

37
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.460
So, deposits, and mortgages,

38
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.485
and retirement, and investments.

39
00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:21.795
And big corporate law firms are often

40
00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:27.243
looking to provide a scope of services to their corporate clients.

41
00:02:27.243 --> 00:02:29.790
And finally, we have product-driven businesses.

42
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.600
So these are businesses that do something unique and proprietary

43
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.040
that either connects with demand in a novel way or extracts some kind of a premium.

44
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.350
So, packaged goods like Nestle or Unilever,

45
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.395
application software, Twitter, Facebook,

46
00:02:46.395 --> 00:02:48.720
media products are product-driven.

47
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.364
They're unique and proprietary.

48
00:02:51.364 --> 00:02:56.655
So, take a minute and think about what kind of business you're working with now,

49
00:02:56.655 --> 00:02:59.276
and which one of these it most resembles.

50
00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:02.950
You'll find probably aspects of all three of these things in your business,

51
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.703
but which one is most important?

52
00:03:04.703 --> 00:03:07.380
Because that's going to have a lot of implications for

53
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.470
where you focus and how you decide what's really

54
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.642
important as you design and deploy enterprise software.

55
00:03:16.642 --> 00:03:18.985
Okay, let's do a quick quiz.

56
00:03:18.985 --> 00:03:22.981
ExxonMobil. What kind of business do you think that is?

57
00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:26.205
Well, and this is an oil company.

58
00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:27.860
If you said infrastructure,

59
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.220
I would say that you're right,

60
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.550
that's what it principally is.

61
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.780
What about Kaiser Permanente?

62
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.053
This is a healthcare provider in the United States.

63
00:03:39.053 --> 00:03:40.890
And if you said scope,

64
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.160
I would probably say that's the best description of their focus.

65
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.290
They're looking to provide a whole bunch of

66
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.510
different healthcare services to the individual as opposed to,

67
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.545
for instance, a doctor that just runs them in practice and specializes in one thing.

68
00:03:56.545 --> 00:03:58.545
What about IBM?

69
00:03:58.545 --> 00:04:02.320
Well, this is kind of an interesting case because IBM is kind of switch between

70
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.605
being product-driven when they were selling computers back when,

71
00:04:06.605 --> 00:04:11.384
and now with their artificial intelligence and big data platforms,

72
00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:15.835
versus they have for a long time been also focused back on consulting,

73
00:04:15.835 --> 00:04:17.740
so large corporate IT consulting.

74
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.878
So, this may be an example of where it's important to fix on one of these,

75
00:04:22.878 --> 00:04:25.865
and that helps drive success for the company.

76
00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:28.910
Johnson & Johnson, I would say is a product company.

77
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.360
I mean, they're selling Band-Aids next to the CBS or supermarket generic Band-Aids,

78
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.670
and trying to sell those at a premium.

79
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.545
FedEx, which is a shipper of packages and letters,

80
00:04:41.545 --> 00:04:43.295
I would say is an infrastructure business.

81
00:04:43.295 --> 00:04:46.893
They're driven by skill and repeatability of that infrastructure.

82
00:04:46.893 --> 00:04:48.355
And United Children's Theater,

83
00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:50.240
what would you say they are?

84
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.910
I would say, principally,

85
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.110
they're an infrastructure business.

86
00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:01.100
They're trying to create a highly repeatable basis to offer programming to students.

87
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.650
So, why does this matter,

88
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.885
and how would it change your decisions around enterprise software?

89
00:05:07.885 --> 00:05:10.805
Well, let's take sales process for example.

90
00:05:10.805 --> 00:05:13.030
In an infrastructure driven business,

91
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.370
this is going to be relatively standardized.

92
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.590
If you call the phone company and ask for something

93
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.280
really special on your residential internet service,

94
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.285
they're going to think you're crazy, right?

95
00:05:24.285 --> 00:05:26.060
Whereas with a scope-driven business,

96
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.780
if you go to a retailer and you have questions,

97
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.440
or you're looking for something specific,

98
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.040
they'll probably try to order it for you or find it for you.

99
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.470
And with a product-driven business, ideally,

100
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.370
they're selling to retailers or other types of

101
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.686
distributors and their sales process is highly simplified.

102
00:05:44.686 --> 00:05:47.955
Pricing and packaging, customer support,

103
00:05:47.955 --> 00:05:53.400
these follow very similar patterns in terms of how tightly standardized do we want this,

104
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.610
versus how flexible for example.

105
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.350
And this has lots and lots of implications for what

106
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:05.535
a good workable strategically thoughtful enterprise software implementation should mean.

107
00:06:05.535 --> 00:06:09.460
And these are just a few example iof areas I think you'll find if you try this out,

108
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.485
and bear this in mind as you make decisions and come your focal points,

109
00:06:13.485 --> 00:06:17.847
that it has lots of implications for the way that you do things.

110
00:06:17.847 --> 00:06:18.908
So take a minute.

111
00:06:18.908 --> 00:06:22.275
Think about the key activities that are uniquely,

112
00:06:22.275 --> 00:06:24.600
strategically important to running the business.

113
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.150
So, by unique, I mean,

114
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.925
it may be important to write good legal contracts and keep the books straight.

115
00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:35.280
But if that isn't uniquely that's just as important to you as the next guy,

116
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.133
that's probably not a good example of a key activity.

117
00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:44.844
Think about the things that are both strategic and unique to the business.

118
00:06:44.844 --> 00:06:50.120
Here's an example of what that looks like at United Children's Theater.

119
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.630
They will develop curriculum.

120
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.420
And they're not going to usually create that from scratch,

121
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.060
they're going to license songs and plays from other people that

122
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.030
are more maybe product-driven places.

123
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.345
And student development means,

124
00:07:03.345 --> 00:07:09.430
we find the students who are a good fit and we have a nice systematic program from,

125
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.220
let's say they start in third grade and finish in 12th grade.

126
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.920
School programming means connecting with

127
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.430
local schools and bringing them in to see the plays and performances,

128
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.975
and generally being a good partner to them as an outsource arts provider.

129
00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:28.240
Volunteer development means getting those parents to help out with organizing events,

130
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.235
and answering questions on Facebook,

131
00:07:30.235 --> 00:07:31.750
and talking to other parents,

132
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.090
and answering the questions about the program so

133
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.925
that United Children's Theater can run at a lower cost.

134
00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:40.015
And donor development means,

135
00:07:40.015 --> 00:07:42.565
finding donors whose charter and interests

136
00:07:42.565 --> 00:07:45.303
align with what they do at United Children's Theater,

137
00:07:45.303 --> 00:07:48.677
and getting those funds they need to run the business.

138
00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:51.445
Now, let's take a look at key resources.

139
00:07:51.445 --> 00:07:55.795
These are the assets that the business is in possession of,

140
00:07:55.795 --> 00:07:57.484
or will be in possession of,

141
00:07:57.484 --> 00:08:01.745
that are uniquely, strategically important to run the business.

142
00:08:01.745 --> 00:08:03.550
So, take a minute and think about those,

143
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:08.060
and then I'll show you an example for United Children's Theater.

144
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.890
For United Children's Theater,

145
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.940
their track record in the community,

146
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.440
the fact that they have been doing this

147
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.860
successfully for so many years, is really important.

148
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.610
Their facility, they're conveniently located in a part of town

149
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.220
where students from multiple school districts

150
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.420
can reach them without too much trouble, that's really important.

151
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.560
Most of their donors are repeat donors.

152
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.018
So those relationships that they have with the donors,

153
00:08:33.018 --> 00:08:35.020
it lowers their costs of sale,

154
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.628
and helps them raise the money reliably that they need,

155
00:08:39.628 --> 00:08:42.553
the curriculum that they put together, that's an asset,

156
00:08:42.553 --> 00:08:48.113
and so is that volunteer base that they get from volunteer development.

157
00:08:48.113 --> 00:08:52.790
Okay. So, this is what the whole business model canvas will look like filled out.

158
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.280
Now, I know that we didn't explicitly cover a few things like cost structure,

159
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.110
key partners, revenue, and that's what the last five is for.

160
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.900
So, the last five of your 20 minutes here,

161
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.645
spend that time stitching this all together,

162
00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:06.710
seeing how it looks,

163
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.255
feel free to revise it,

164
00:09:08.255 --> 00:09:11.890
but think about those key relationships.

165
00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.925
Do these two things really make sense together,

166
00:09:14.925 --> 00:09:16.400
and do they complement each other?

167
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.960
Do these propositions really resonate with these customers?

168
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.630
Does the material that you put here dovetail with

169
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.570
what you're actually observing about the way that customers interact with the business?

170
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.110
And what are the things that are uniquely,

171
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.835
strategically important to the business,

172
00:09:31.835 --> 00:09:35.575
and who are partners that do some of those things for you?

173
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:38.376
And then how does that relate to revenue and cost drivers?

174
00:09:38.376 --> 00:09:40.250
Those are the things that you want to pencil

175
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.520
through as you finish up the business model canvas.

176
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.530
In the next set of material,

177
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.970
we're going to look at how we can use this business model canvas to drive

178
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.970
some really thoughtful ideas about

179
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:57.065
process prototypes that we can use to link with our user stories.

180
00:09:57.065 --> 00:09:59.360
These are really useful assets because they

181
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.120
help you think about what's valuable and what's

182
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.890
important about what you're going to do with

183
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:07.990
this enterprise software before you go off and start building stuff that,

184
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.810
as we've seen in the intro,

185
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.795
is maybe very much at risk of being something that users don't like.

186
00:10:13.795 --> 00:10:18.020
So, come with me and we're going to go look at how to think through

187
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:23.510
processes in a thoughtful way to drive to what's valuable for the user.
